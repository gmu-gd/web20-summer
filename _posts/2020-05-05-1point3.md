This tutorial will go through the set up every HTML page uses (steps 1&ndash;6) and the basic elements you can use to get text to appear on screen. It will also help you get _E1: 20 Questions_ started if you need some extra guidance.

### <span id="step1">Step 1: Create HTML file</span>

Open your text editor and start a new file. To save a new file you can go to <span class="command">_File > New File_</span> or use <span class="command">_cmd+n_</span>. Now before you do any typing in the document you need to save the file <span class="command">_File > Save_</span> or use <span class="command">_cmd+s_</span>. When you save a file you need to name the file and give it a file type/extension. Name this **e1.html** and save it to your desktop. **e1** is the file name and **.html** is the file extension. Remember that you need to type the file extension so the text editor knows what kind of file it is working with.

### <span id="step2">Step 2: Add doctype</span>
Now that your text editor knows what kind of file it is working with you can start writing in html. The first thing you need on line 1 is our document declaration type which is `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This lets the browser know which HTML specification to use to interpret the document, in this case you are writing in HTML5.

### <span id="step3">Step 3: Add html element</span>
Now that the browser knows what HTML specification you are writing in you can start to write your HTML. The first element is going to be the `html` element. The `html` element is called the root element because it contains all the elements in the document.

On line 2 write the opening tag `<html>` and on line 3 write the closing tag `</html>`. Remember that almost every HTML element you write will have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Save the document with a <span class="command">_cmd+s_</span>. Saving with the key command instead of going to <span class="command">_File > Save_</span> is going to be faster and make saving easier.

### <span id="step4">Step 4: Add head element</span>
There are a few more elements you need to add before you can start adding content to the page. Put your cursor at the end of line 2 and press <span class="command">_return_</span> which will add a new blank line between the `html` element. Now press <span class="command">_tab_</span> to indent the cursor one level on line 3. Indenting is an important part of coding that allows humans to quickly see the structure of a document. Now add the `head` element to your page. On the indented line 3 write the opening tag `<head>` and then press <span class="command">_return_</span> then <span class="command">_tab_</span> and write the closing tag `</head>` on the indented line 4. Make sure the opening and closing tags are at the same indent level as each other.

The `head` element contains elements that pertain to the document that are not rendered as part of the content, such as its title, style sheets, scripts, and metadata.

### <span id="step5">Step 5: Add meta and title elements</span>
Put your cursor at the end of line 3 and press <span class="command">_return_</span> which will add a new blank line between the `head` element. Depending on your text editor this might automatically indent or you might need to indent it two levels. The indent this time is two levels because you are writing inside the `head` element.

On line 4 write the meta tag that specifies the character encoding used in the document `<meta charset="utf-8">`. Notice this element does not have a closing tag.

At the end of line 4 press <span class="command">_return_</span> and make sure you are two indent levels in and add the `title` element. This can be done all on one line and will look something like this `<title>E1</title`. The `title` element has an opening tag, some content (in this case E1), and a closing tag. The title should describe the title of the page you are working on and appears in the tab of the browser.

### <span id="step6">Step 6: Add body element</span>
The last step before you start adding content to the page is adding the `body` element. The `body` element contains everything you want to show up in the browser window.

Add the `body` element below the closing tag of the `head` element. The `body` element needs an opening tag `<body>` and a closing tag `</body>` and should be at the same indent level as the `head` element.

If you haven't saved since step 3 now might be a good time.

### <span id="step7">Step 7: Add content</span>
Now that your document is set up you can start adding content. For a reference of text elements we have talked about so far, look at the Lesson 1.2 PDF on Blackboard. Remember, every piece of text you want to show up on the live page should be contained in an text element.

The first bit of content you should add is a some kind of title most likely using an `h1` element. Since you might be working on Exercise 1, perhaps your text could be _E1: 20 Questions_ and look something like this `<h1>E1: 20 Questions</h1>`. Remember to include the opening tag, content, and closing tag here. This should be written inside the `body` element and be indented 2 levels. This text is inside an `h1` element because it is primary heading of our page. If there are more heading elements on the page there is still `h2` through `h6` available.

Next add the first question. The way here is one way to approach this but like with most things in design and coding there are many solutions.

What text element should you choose if you want text that says "Question 1"? You don't want to use the `h1` element because that should only be used once on a page. So how about an `h2` element? That is still available and can be used as the heading element for all the questions. Make sure you are writing in the body element, on a new line below your `h1` element, and indented to the proper level and write `<h2>Question 1</h2>`.

Don't forget to save!

Finally add the question text and your answer. Again there are a lot of ways you could do this but here is one approach. Make sure you replace the text inside the `p` element with an actual question and an actual answer. Each `p` element should be on its own line and indented to the proper level.

`<p>Q: This is the text for the question?</p>`
`<p>A: This is the answer for the question.</p>`

### <span id="step8">Step 8: Previewing the page</span>

Now that you have a document with the proper structure and content with the proper mark up it's time to see what the page looks like! One way to do that is to find the file on your desktop and drag it into a browser or double click on it. That should open it up in your default browser. The other way is to click and drag the icon next to the file name in the top bar of the Atom window into the browser. This is a little tricky sometimes but once you get the hang of it is a lot faster. But however you get the file open in the browser you should have something that looks like this.

This page is using the default browser styles which for now is fine. The goal of this lesson is to create a simple HTML page with a good structure and marked up correctly. As the class goes on you will learn more about styling the page.

To finish the exercise you can repeat step 7 until you have your questions and answers all on the page.
