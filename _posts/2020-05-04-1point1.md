This tutorial will go through the process of setting up Github so that you can put your work on a live website. This tutorial will be filled out shortly.

### <span id="step1">Step 1: Make a Github account</span>
Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/) and set up an account if you do not have one yet. You should be able to sign up from that page. Make sure you use an email address you use and a password you will remember. You will have verify your email so make sure you do that too.

### <span id="step2">Step 2: Make a Github Repository</span>
#### Step 2A: New Repository
Once you have made and verified your account, sign in to Github. On the main page you should see an option to create a repository. Wherever that might be, click it to start the process of creating a new repository. On the screenshot below it is the green button that says "new" over in the left sidebar.

#### Step 2B: Create Repository
On the next screen you need to fill in a few pieces of information. You need to fill in the repository name. This can be anything but I would recommend something like "avt217" or "introtoweb" or something similar. I would keep it all lowercase and don't use any spaces. You do not need a description and keep the repository public. The final step here is to check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README." Not checking this box will force you to delete the repository and start over so make sure you check it.

Once you have a repository name and have checked the box, click "Create repository."

#### Step 2C: Create gh-pages Branch
After you click "Create repository" it should take you to a page that looks like this:

![image of created repository page]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/1p1/step2c1.png "Step 2c")

If your page does not look like that image you need to make a new repository and make sure you check the "Initialize this repository with a README" box.

Once your repository landing page looks like the above screenshot look for the button around the middle of the page on the left side that says "Branch: master" and click it. In the text field that pops up type "gh-pages" and then click "Create branch: gh-pages from 'master'".

The screen should look generally the same but you should have a "Branch created" banner at the top and the button that used to say "Branch: master" should now say "Branch: gh-pages".

### <span id="step3">Step 3: Download the Github Desktop app</span>
Go to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/) and download the Github Desktop app. This screen should recognize the operating system you are using and present you with the appropriate download option.

Once you have downloaded it, install it on your computer, open it up, and log in with your github.com account.

### <span id="step4">Step 4: Clone your repository</span>

### <span id="step5">Step 5: Pushing work</span>
