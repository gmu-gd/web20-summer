### Description
Students will conceptualize, plan, design, and code a multipage website using one of several provided topics. The project will build off of the lessons each week and be a synthesis of the concepts and skills learned over the course of the semester. Each student's project will be unique in content and form but be based on the same basic set of requirements.

The topics to choose from and general requirement are below.


### Topics
#### Food Based
Create a website for a fictional restaurant, Pines of Nowhere. Pines of Nowhere is a Modern American restaurant  dedicated to seasonal cooking and sourcing from local farms and waters. Our menu showcases the bounty of the Chesapeake Bay watershed in thoughtful, delicious and beautiful dishes that aim to nourish and surprise. The food is accompanied by a program of fine craft cocktails and an expertly curated wine list. Each week, a limited number of 15-course tasting menus are available at our chef’s counter, offering parties of two a unique and intimate chef-driven experience.

##### Necessary Pages
* _Home_ &ndash; A page that gives a visitor an overview of what the site is for as well as drawing the visitor to stay on the site. Does not need a lot of information but should have some text, images, and/or graphics.
* _About_ &ndash; Gives an overview of the restaurant. A place for the location, about the restaurant, hours, contact info, etc.
* _Menu_ &ndash; This page needs a dinner menu appropriate for the restaurant. If you are having trouble finding content, use this [menu]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/p1/menu.txt)
* _Events_ &ndash; Pines of Nowhere hosts special events in the restaurant. The restaurant allows full buy outs for events but also will allow events hosted on the patio and in the private dining room.

#### Art Based
Create a website for The Velvet Velvet, a fictional gallery. Every year, The Velvet Velvet features three to four larger shows about graphic design and architecture, with smaller monthly exhibits featuring work from local designers. Nothing on display will be for sale. The Velvet Velvet is like a free private museum of design scholarship meant to appeal to the whims of its founders—and hopefully the community.

In addition to the small and larger exhibits, one will find for sale a modest selection of books and magazines about graphic design, typography, and architecture from publishers all over the world.

You can find small design/design related exhibits from existing galleries or make up your own. Each exhibition should have a title, sentence or two of descriptive text, dates, and any other relevant information. You should have an image for the exhibition but do not need to build an individual page for each exhibition.
* _Shop_ &ndash; Curate a selection of books and magazines the gallery might sell. Could be related to current and future exhibitions you found or more general books. You should have at least ten items in the shop.

#### Music Based
Create a website for the fictional band, Dauphine's Revival. There are two options here. You can come up with the genre of music the band plays or you can use the following.

Part Jimi Hendrix, part James Brown and all New Orleans, Dauphine's Revival is a hard-edged funk band that employs brass-band beats, rock dynamics and improvisation in a jazz tradition. NPR hailed them as “New Orleans’ brightest new stars in a generation,” and New York Magazine wrote that “Dauphine's Revival takes in a century-plus worth of sounds—ragtime and jazz and gospel and soul and R&B and hip-hop—and attacks everything they play with festive fervor.” Here is a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0QWli5D7u30kIWANKYNhgQ?si=arNZCl6TTumTaGWysJ_pcg) of the kind of music the band plays.
