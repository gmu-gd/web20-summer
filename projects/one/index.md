### Description
Students will conceptualize, plan, design, and code a multipage website using one of several provided topics. The project will build off of the lessons each week and be a synthesis of the concepts and skills learned over the course of the semester. Each student's project will be unique in content and form but be based on the same set of requirements.


### Topics
#### Food Based
Create a website for a fictional restaurant, Pines of Nowhere. Pines of Nowhere is a Modern American restaurant  dedicated to seasonal cooking and sourcing from local farms and waters. Our menu showcases the bounty of the Chesapeake Bay watershed in thoughtful, delicious and beautiful dishes that aim to nourish and surprise. The food is accompanied by a program of fine craft cocktails and an expertly curated wine list. Each week, a limited number of 15-course tasting menus are available at our chef’s counter, offering parties of two a unique and intimate chef-driven experience.

#### Art Based
Create a website for The Velvet Velvet, a fictional gallery. Every year, The Velvet Velvet will feature three to four larger shows about graphic design, typography, and printed ephemera, with smaller monthly exhibits featuring local type designers and notable graphic designers. Nothing on display will be for sale. Katherine Small Gallery is like a free private museum of design scholarship meant to appeal to the whims of its founders—and hopefully the community.

In addition to the small and larger exhibits, one will find for sale a modest selection of books and magazines about graphic design and typography from publishers all over the world.

#### Music Based
Create a website for the fictional band, The Holland March Trio.

#### Place Based
Create a website for a real, major city of your choosing.
