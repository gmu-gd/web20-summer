<h4 id="food-based">Food Based</h4>
<p>Create a website for a fictional restaurant, Pines of Nowhere. Pines of Nowhere is a Modern American restaurant  dedicated to seasonal cooking and sourcing from local farms and waters. Our menu showcases the bounty of the Chesapeake Bay watershed in thoughtful, delicious and beautiful dishes that aim to nourish and surprise. The food is accompanied by a program of fine craft cocktails and an expertly curated wine list. Each week, a limited number of 15-course tasting menus are available at our chef’s counter, offering parties of two a unique and intimate chef-driven experience.</p>

<h5 id="necessary-pages">Necessary Pages</h5>
<ul>
  <li><em>Home</em> – A page that gives a visitor an overview of what the site is for as well as drawing the visitor to stay on the site. Does not need a lot of information but should have some text, images, and/or graphics.</li>
  <li><em>About</em> – Gives an overview of the restaurant. A place for the location, about the restaurant, hours, contact info, etc.</li>
  <li><em>Menu</em> – This page needs a dinner menu appropriate for the restaurant. If you are having trouble finding content, use this <a href="/assets/p1/menu.txt">menu</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Create a website for The Velvet Velvet, a fictional gallery. Every year, The Velvet Velvet will feature three to four larger shows about graphic design, typography, and printed ephemera, with smaller monthly exhibits featuring local type designers and notable graphic designers. Nothing on display will be for sale. Katherine Small Gallery is like a free private museum of design scholarship meant to appeal to the whims of its founders—and hopefully the community.</p>

<p>In addition to the small and larger exhibits, one will find for sale a modest selection of books and magazines about graphic design and typography from publishers all over the world.</p>

<p>Create a website for the fictional band, The Holland March Trio.</p>
