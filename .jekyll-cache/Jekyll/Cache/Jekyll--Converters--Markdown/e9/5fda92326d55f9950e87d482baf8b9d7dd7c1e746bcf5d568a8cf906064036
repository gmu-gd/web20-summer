I"Ò<p>This tutorial will explain how to bring in fonts from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">fonts.google.com</a> and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/">fonts.adobe.com</a>. This tutorial will use your main <strong>index.html</strong> file and its associated CSS file to bring in the fonts.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-open-your-repository-and-files"><span id="step1">Step 1: Open Your Repository and Files</span></h3>
<p>Open your repository in Atom and then open up your main <strong>index.html</strong> file and CSS file associated with it by double clicking on the file in the tree view.</p>

<p>Once both are open you can view them side by side by dragging the the tab with your CSS file to the right until the right column is highlighted. Then you can leet go and you should be able to see both files as a split screen in Atom. If you don‚Äôt want to work this way that‚Äôs okay.</p>

<p>In that screenshot you will notice that I have some of the default styles reset that we talked about in The CSS Box Model lecture.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-choose-google-fonts"><span id="step2">Step 2: Choose Google Fonts</span></h3>
<p>Open up your browser and go to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">fonts.google.com</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/3p1/step2.png" alt="fonts.google.com homepage" title="Step 2" /></p>

<h4 id="step-2a-select-a-font-family">Step 2a: Select a Font Family</h4>
<p>There are a lot of font families on Google Fonts. Take a minute to browse through and find one you want to use on your site. In the top right of each font family box there is some text that says ‚Äú1 style‚Äù or ‚Äú6 styles‚Äù or ‚Äúvariable‚Äù. Select a font family that has 2 or more styles and stay away from variable for the moment. Once you found the font family you want to use, click on it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/3p1/step2a.png" alt="a font family selected" title="Step 2a" /></p>

<h4 id="step-2b-select-styles">Step 2b: Select Styles</h4>
<p>On this screen you need to select the styles you are going to use. Try an select only the ones you plan on using. You don‚Äôt need to pick a font family that has 28 styles and then select all 28 to actually use. I typically try to get a regular, regular italic, bold, and bold italic as a starting point. Usually I will need at least those four but if you think you might need any extra select away.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/3p1/step2b.png" alt="styles selected" title="Step 2b" /></p>

<h4 id="step-2c-get-code">Step 2c: Get Code</h4>
<p>After you have your styles selected you can click on the icon in the top right. It has three squares and a plus sign and should have a red circle in the top right. If you click on this a panel should slide on the screen that shows your selected family.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/3p1/step2c1.png" alt="a font family selected" title="Step 2c" /></p>

<p>Check to make sure what you think should be there is there and then click on the ‚ÄúEmbed‚Äù tab at the top of the panel. This will bring up the tab that has the code for you to link to the fonts from your HTML document and add the font family to your CSS.</p>

<h4 id="step-2d-copy-link-and-paste-in-html-document">Step 2d: Copy Link and Paste in HTML Document</h4>
<p>Copy the first bit of code there under the <link />. Once it is copied go back to Atom and paste it in your <strong>index.html</strong> file. Where should you paste it you might ask? It should go in the <span class="spoiler">head</span> of course!</p>

<h3 id="step-3-add-in-basic-html-setup"><span id="step3">Step 3: Add in Basic HTML Setup</span></h3>
<p>Your HTML file should still be open but if it isn‚Äôt make sure your HTML file in the Exercise 2 folder is open and add in the minimum HTML set up, give it a descriptive <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code> and then save the file.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2p2/step3.png" alt="html file with minimum HTML" title="Step 3" /></p>

<h3 id="step-4-add-an-image"><span id="step4">Step 4: Add an Image</span></h3>

<p>To get images to display on your page you need to add the image element <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;img&gt;</code>. The image element needs two attributes, <code class="highlighter-rouge">src</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">alt</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">src</code> attribute is where the path to the image file goes and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">alt</code> attribute holds text to display if the image link is broken or the user is using a screen reader. The image element is also an empty element so there is no content or closing tag.</p>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">body</code> add an image element, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;img src="#" alt="#"&gt;</code>. Make sure it is indented one level since it is a child of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">body</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2p2/step4a1.png" alt="image element added in the body" title="Step 4" /></p>

<p>Now replace the two attributes with the appropriate values. <code class="highlighter-rouge">src</code> ‚Äì <span class="spoiler">src=‚Äùimages/1.png‚Äù</span>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">alt</code> - <span class="spoiler">alt=‚Äùshape layout 1‚Äù</span>. Once again the path in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">src</code> attribute is dependent on your folder and file naming. This path works for my file and folder naming, if yours is different the path needs to be different.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2p2/step4a2.png" alt="image element with attribute values added" title="Step 4" /></p>

<p>Before you add the other images it is worth saving the file and checking to see if everything is working in the browser. Once you have checked and verified that the image is displaying on the page, repeat this step four more times to add all of your images for Exercise 2 onto the page.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2p2/step4a3.png" alt="all five images added to the HTML file" title="Step 4" /></p>

<h3 id="step-5-link-to-exercise-2"><span id="step5">Step 5: Link to Exercise 2</span></h3>

<p>The last step is adding a link to your main page for Exercise 2. So open up your index.html file in your root directory and add in an anchor element, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;a href="#"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code> for Exercise 2. Make sure you are wrapping the text inside the list item for Exercise 2 and make sure you have an opening tag and closing tag. The value for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">href</code> attribute is dependent on your folder and file structure.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2p2/step5.png" alt="adding a link to e2 on the homepage" title="Step 5" /></p>

<p>Make sure both files are saved and preview the homepage and test to see if the link for Exercise 2 is working. If it is, great! You can open up the Github App and push the changes you just made. If it isn‚Äôt working, check to make sure all your syntax, spelling, and paths are correct and try it again. If it still isn‚Äôt working, ask for help.</p>

<h3 id="step-6-add-e3-e4-and-e5"><span id="step5">Step 6: Add E3, E4, and E5</span></h3>

<p>You should now be able to add all the image files for your exercises to an HTML page and links to access those pages. Try that for practice. The end result should look something like our <a href="https://mmcdermott18.github.io/su2020-avt217/">class demo repository</a>.</p>
