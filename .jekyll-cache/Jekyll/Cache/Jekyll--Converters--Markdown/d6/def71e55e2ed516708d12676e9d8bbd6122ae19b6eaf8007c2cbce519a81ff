I"Ã&<p>This tutorial will go getting the homepage of your repository setup to be an archive of the work you are creating for this class.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-set-up-the-html-file"><span id="step1">Step 1: Set up the HTML file</span></h3>
<p>The first step is opening up your text editor, creating a new file, and saving it in the root directory of your repository as index.html. Once you have done that add in the basic HTML set up (steps 1 through 6 of <a href="/tutorials/1-point-2">tutorial 1.2</a>). Make sure you make the text in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code> element is something useful. At the end your file should look something like the image below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2p1/step1.png" alt="basic html setup in Atom" title="Step 1" /></p>

<h3 id="step-2-adding-content"><span id="step2">Step 2: Adding Content</span></h3>
<p>Now that the file is set up you can add some content. This page is going to be a list of links to the work for the class. It should have some large text at the top to give the page a title and then a bunch of links underneath that. All of this content is going to go in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">body</code> element.</p>

<h4 id="step-2a-add-your-main-heading">Step 2a: Add your main heading</h4>
<p>Start with a title for your page using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">h1</code> element. Something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;h1&gt;Michael's Work&lt;/h1&gt;</code> or some other way to identify this page as yours.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2p1/step2a.png" alt="h1 element added to body" title="Step 2a" /></p>

<h4 id="step-2b-add-an-unordered-list">Step 2b: Add an Unordered List</h4>

<p>There are a lot of different ways to add links to a document. Since this going to be a list of links and we want to markup the document semantically, a list element makes sense. A list with numbers next to it isnâ€™t important here so use an unordered list element, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</code>. Add the opening tag for the unordered list on the line beneath the <code class="highlighter-rouge">h1</code> element and the closing tag for the unordered list two lines beneath that. This leaves space to add a list item inside the unordered list. All of the elements inside the body element are at the same indent level so far.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2p1/step2b.png" alt="ul element added to the body" title="Step 2b" /></p>

<h4 id="step-2c-add-a-list-item">Step 2c: Add a List Item</h4>

<p>The text inside a list is all contained in the list item element, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;</code>. On the line between the opening and closing tags for the unordered list, add a list item with some text that identifies this list item as Exercise 1, something like, â€œE1: 20 Questionsâ€. Note that this <code class="highlighter-rouge">li</code> element is indent another level because it is a child of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ul</code> element. Also a good time to save, <span class="command"><em>cmd+s</em></span> if you havenâ€™t yet</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2p1/step2c.png" alt="li element added inside the ul element" title="Step 2c" /></p>

<h4 id="step-2d-add-more-list-items">Step 2d: Add More List Items</h4>
<p>Add a new line beneath the <code class="highlighter-rouge">li</code> for E1 and make a <code class="highlighter-rouge">li</code> for E2. Repeat this process until you have list items for E1 through E5. All of these should be at the same level indent as the first <code class="highlighter-rouge">li</code> because they are all children of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ul</code> element.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2p1/step2d.png" alt="more li elements" title="Step 2d" /></p>

<h3 id="step-3-create-a-grid"><span id="step3">Step 3: Create a Grid</span></h3>
<p>Before you start adding anything to your artboard you want to set up a grid. This is accomplished by finding the grid section of the right sidebar and checking the box next to the layout dropdown. When you check that box it will bring up options for you to create your grid.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1p3/step3.png" alt="image of Xd grid options" title="Step 3" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Columns â€“Â How many columns are on the artboard. Also if you click the color to the left of the word â€œColumnsâ€ you can change the column color and opacity.</li>
  <li>Gutter Width â€“Â The width between the columns</li>
  <li>Column Width â€“Â The width of each column</li>
  <li>Two Icons â€“ The first sets the margins for the left and right equally. The second allows you to set the margins independently. Generally leave it on the first option.</li>
</ul>

<p>Play around with these options and see what happens. There is no particular number for columns, widths, or gutters so it is up to you. In Exercise 2 you will be making 5 different artboards with 5 different grids so you can see what works well for you.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-add-a-polygon"><span id="step4">Step 4: Add a Polygon</span></h3>
<p>This tutorial is built around Exercise 2 so the content you will be adding to your artboard are shapes. In the left toolbar there are a few different shape tools you can use â€” rectangle <em>r</em>, ellipse <em>e</em>, and polygon <em>y</em>. The rectangle and ellipse tool draw what they say and if you hold <em>shift</em> while drawing the shape you will get a square or a circle. The polygon tool is a little different so choose that one or press <em>y</em>.</p>

<p>By default the polygon tool draws a triangle and if you hold shift it will draw and equilateral triangle. Draw a triangle on your artboard and make sure it aligns to the grid you made. The mouse should snap to the edges of the columns.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1p3/step4a.png" alt="image of triangle on the artboard" title="Step 4a" /></p>

<p>The default drawing of the triangle for me is a white fill with a grey border. The options in the â€œAppearanceâ€ section in the right sidebar are generally the same for the rectangle and ellipse tools but the polygon tool has a few added options to control what the polygon looks like. Any option with a checkbox next to it means you can turn it on or off using that checkbox and the settings are saved.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1p3/step4b.png" alt="image of appearance settings" title="Step 4b" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Opacity Slider â€“Â Change the opacity of the shape.</li>
  <li>Blend Mode Dropdown â€“Â Set the blend mode for the shape.</li>
  <li>Corner Count â€“Â Adds more corners to the shape. 3 corners is a triangle, 4 is a diamond, 5 is a pentagon, and so on.</li>
  <li>Corner Radius â€“ Rounds the corners.</li>
  <li>Star Ratio â€“ Bends the sides in to make star like shapes.</li>
  <li>Fill â€“ Click on the rectangle to change the color, click on â€œSolid Colorâ€ at the top to change the kind of fill (Gradients!).</li>
  <li>Border â€“ Click on the rectangle to change the color.</li>
  <li>Border Size â€“ Change the size of the border.</li>
  <li>Dash â€“Â Make a dashed line, pairs with the Gap option to control the look of the dashed border.</li>
  <li>Border Alignment Icons â€“Â Aligns the border to the Inner, Outer, or Center of the stroke.</li>
  <li>Border Cap Icons â€“ Sets the end caps as Butt, Round, or Projecting.</li>
  <li>Corner Join Options â€“Â Sets the corner join as Miter, Round, or Bevel.</li>
  <li>Shadow â€“ Click on the set shadow color.</li>
  <li>Shadow Options â€“ If a shadow color is selected these options will appear, X and Y adjust the offset from the shape and B adjusts the blur of the shadow.</li>
  <li>Background Blur â€“ Uses shape as a mask to blur the elements behind it, three slider options to control blur amount, brightness, and effect opacity.</li>
  <li>Object Blur â€“Â Blurs the object itself, one slider option to control blur amount.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-5-add-more-shapes"><span id="step5">Step 5: Add More Shapes</span></h3>
<p>Now, using the grid you set up, add more shapes to create a layout. The layout will be relatively abstract and you do not need to make it feel like it could be a real webpage. Feel free to play with the appearance settings for your shapes and make sure you align the shapes to the grid. Also keep in mind white space and the idea that not ever inch of the artboard needs to be covered with shapes. Even space or proportional space between items is generally better than random space.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1p3/step5a.png" alt="image of shapes on an artboard aligning to the grid" title="Step 5a" /></p>

<p>Once you have finished with your layout you can make another artboard by clicking the Artboard tool in the left sidebar or pressing <em>a</em>. You can then draw the artboard just like any other shape and adjust the dimensions to 1440 x 3000 in the transform settings in the right sidebar.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1p3/step5b.png" alt="image of transform settings" title="Step 5b" /></p>

<p>Make a different grid for this artboard and add some more shapes to it just like you did for the first artboard.</p>

<h3 id="step-6-export-artboards"><span id="step6">Step 6: Export Artboards</span></h3>

<p>Once you have five artboards with different grids and different layouts on them, it is time to export. To export the artboards go to <em>File &gt; Export &gt; All Artboardsâ€¦</em>. In the pop up window choose your location and then set the â€œFormatâ€ to PNG, â€œExport Forâ€ to Design, and then click â€œExport All Artboardsâ€.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1p3/step6.png" alt="image of export settings" title="Step 6" /></p>

<p>Now you should have five PNG files that are all 1440px by 3000px. If they are not that size you might have exported at a different size or you didnâ€™t make your artboards the right size. In either case, go back through these steps and make sure the files are the correct size.</p>
