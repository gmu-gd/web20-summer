I"ù<p>This tutorial will go through the set up every HTML page uses (steps 1‚Äì6) and the basic elements you can use to get text to appear on screen. It will also help you get <em>E1: 20 Questions</em> started if you need some extra guidance.</p>

<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>

<p>Open your text editor and start a new file. To save a new file you can go to <span class="command"><em>File &gt; New File</em></span> or use <span class="command"><em>cmd+n</em></span>. Now before you do any typing in the document you need to save the file <span class="command"><em>File &gt; Save</em></span> or use <span class="command"><em>cmd+s</em></span>. When you save a file you need to name the file and give it a file type/extension. Name this <strong>e1.html</strong> and save it to your desktop. <strong>e1</strong> is the file name and <strong>.html</strong> is the file extension. Remember that you need to type the file extension so the text editor knows what kind of file it is working with.</p>

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>
<p>Now that your text editor knows what kind of file it is working with you can start writing in html. The first thing you need on line 1 is our document declaration type which is <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span></code>. This lets the browser know which HTML specification to use to interpret the document, in this case you are writing in HTML5.</p>

<h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>
<p>Now that the browser knows what HTML specification you are writing in you can start to write your HTML. The first element is going to be the <code class="highlighter-rouge">html</code> element. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">html</code> element is called the root element because it contains all the elements in the document.</p>

<p>On line 2 write the opening tag <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span></code> and on line 3 write the closing tag <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;/html&gt;</code>. Remember that almost every HTML element you write will have an opening tag and a closing tag.</p>

<p>Save the document with a <span class="command"><em>cmd+s</em></span>. Saving with the key command instead of going to <span class="command"><em>File &gt; Save</em></span> is going to be faster and make saving easier.</p>

<h3 id="step-4">Step 4</h3>
<p>There are a few more elements you need to add before you can start adding content to the page. Put your cursor at the end of line two and press <span class="command"><em>return</em></span> which will add a new blank line between the <code class="highlighter-rouge">html</code> element. Now press <span class="command"><em>tab</em></span> to indent the cursor one level on line three. Indenting is an important part of coding that allows humans to quickly see the structure of a document. Now add the <code class="highlighter-rouge">head</code> element to your page. On the indented line 3 write the opening tag <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> and then press <span class="command"><em>return</em></span> then <span class="command"><em>tab</em></span> and write the closing tag <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;/head&gt;</code> on the indented line 4. Make sure the opening and closing tags are at the same indent level as each other.</p>
