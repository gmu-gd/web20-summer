<h4 id="exercise-2-make-the-grid"><span id="e2">Exercise 2: Make the Grid</span></h4>
<p>Using XD or other approved design software make 5 artboards that are 1440 pixels wide by 3000 pixels tall. On each artboard create a grid that could be used to layout a website. The grid does not need rows, only columns. Once you have 5 different grids start adding some ‚Äúcontent‚Äù to your pages. The content should be shapes (squares, rectangles, circles) that could represent images, icons, text, etc. Some shapes should be tall, some shapes should be short, some should be wide, and some should be narrow. The grid should be your guide for how your shapes line up and fit on the page. Do not ignore the grid. Keep in mind ideas about space and that every pixel of the page does not need to be filled. Check out the <a href="/tutorials/1-point-3">1.3 tutorial</a> for some help with XD if you need it.</p>

<h5 id="requirements-1">Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>5 png files at 1440px wide by 3000px wide</li>
  <li>Layouts only use shapes</li>

<h4 id="exercise-3-organization-and-naming"><span id="e3">Exercise 3: Organization and Naming</span></h4>
<p>File naming and organization are important parts of making sure your files are easy to find both visually and while writing links. On Blackboard there is a simple site with a terrible file structure. Rename these files something clear and simple and then organize them into a nice folder structure. The site has a main page and then 3 sub pages for an about page, a menus page, and a gallery page.</p>

<p>Once you have organized and renamed the files, take a screenshot of the new structure and post it to your site. If you cannot get a view where all the files and folders are shown in one folder, take multiple screenshots or position multiple folders on the screen to show the structure.</p>

Five of the layouts will just be in black and white with no images and five you can use color and images if you want. Design some pages with one typeface and some pages with multiple typefaces. Try symmetrical and asymmetrical layouts and size, weight, style and other typographic concepts to create a well designed, readable page.</p>

<p>Create a drawing of something in your house using only HTML and CSS. To do this you will draw some divs, position them on the page, and then style each piece with CSS. The divs will then get layered and moved around to make your final drawing.

<h4 id="exercise-13-programmer-and-computer"><span id="e13">Exercise 13: Programmer and Computer</span></h4>
<p><strong>PART 1 - THE PROGRAMMER</strong> Create a simple drawing in XD in 2 minutes. Once you are finished, write a very precise set of instructions that will be executed by a computer. A classmate will be the computer and the result of that person following your program should result in an exact copy of your drawing. You cannot use images or verbal communications to help explain your instructions, only written words. You also cannot let the computer see what the final drawing should look like.</p>

<p>Upload the instructions to your website but do not upload the drawing yet.</p>

<p><strong>PART 2 - THE COMPUTER</strong> Using a classmates program, execute those instructions to recreate the drawing. Do not assume instructions, follow what is written as closely as you can. Send the final drawing back to the programmer. Do this step for two different programs.</p>

<p><strong>PART 3 - UPLOAD</strong> Once you have two drawings back from the two different computers, upload the two drawings along with your original to the same page as the instructions.</p>

<p><strong>BRIEF HISTORY LESSON</strong> A computer was actually a job description held by many humans at one point in time, especially during WWII, where computers (mostly women) were hired to do calculation and computation on vast quantities of numbers. Also, Ada Lovelace (December 10, 1815‚ÄìNovember 17, 1852), the daughter of poet Lord Byron, published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine and is regarded as the first computer programmer. Furthermore, the term ‚Äúdebugging‚Äù originated from the actions of programmer Grace Hopper (December 9, 1906‚ÄìJanuary 1, 1992), who took a literal moth out of military computer. In today‚Äôs male-dominated tech fields, it‚Äôs important recognize the roots of computation and programming.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1 ‚Äì Interactions</strong> Create a single page that has at least three unique interactions on it using jQuery. The interactions should each use a different mouse event to start the interaction and each mouse event should do something different. For example, a mouse click could change the color of an object but hovering could change the position of some text. The content of the page should be a list of your top five favorite somethings. That could be your top five favorite songs, movies, places in the world, colors, etc.</p>

<p>The interactions should not be hidden and should try to have some relevance to the content of your list.</p>
