<p>This tutorial will go through the set up every HTML page uses (steps 1â€“6) and the basic elements we can use to get text to appear on screen. The tutorial will help you get <em>E1: 20 Questions</em> started.</p>

<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>

<p>Open your text editor and start a new file. To save a new file you can go to <span class="command"><em>File &gt; New File</em></span> or use <span class="command"><em>cmd+n</em></span>. Now before you do any typing in the document you need to save the file <span class="command"><em>File &gt; Save</em></span> or use <span class="command"><em>cmd+s</em></span>. When we save a file we need to name the file and give it a file type. For this file letâ€™s name it <strong>e1.html</strong> and save it to your desktop. Remember that you need to type the .html part of the name so the text editor knows what kind of file it is working with.</p>

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>
<p>Now that your text editor knows what kind of file it is working with you can start writing in html. The first thing you need on line 1 is our document declaration type which is <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span></code>. This lets the browser know which HTML specification to use to interpret the document, in this case you are writing in HTML5.</p>

<h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>
<p>Now that the browser knows what HTML specification you are writing in you can start to write your HTML. The first element is going to be the <code class="highlighter-rouge">html</code> element. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">html</code> element is called the root element because it contains all the elements in the document.</p>

<p>On line 2 write the opening tag <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span></code> and on line 3 write the closing tag <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;/html&gt;</code>. Remember that almost every HTML element you write will have an opening tag and a closing tag.</p>

<p>Save the document with a <span class="command"><em>cmd+s</em></span>. Saving with the key command instead of going to <span class="command"><em>File &gt; Save</em></span> is going to be faster and make saving easier.</p>
