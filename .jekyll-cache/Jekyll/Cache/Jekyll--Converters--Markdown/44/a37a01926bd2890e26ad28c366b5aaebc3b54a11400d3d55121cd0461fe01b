I"}<p>This tutorial will go through some of the basic features of Adobe Xd and help with  <em>E2: Make the Grid</em>. This tutorial will be available shortly.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-downloadinstallopen-adobe-xd"><span id="step1">Step 1: Download/Install/Open Adobe XD</span></h3>
<p>If you don’t have Adobe Xd yet you can download it <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html?promoid=PYPVQ3HN&amp;mv=other">here</a>. Xd should be free but I think you will need an Adobe account to use the program. Once you have it downloaded, install it and open it.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-create-a-new-document"><span id="step2">Step 2: Create a New Document</span></h3>
<p>When you open up Xd you should be presented this screen.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1p3/step2a.png" alt="image of Xd welcome screen" title="Step 2a" /></p>

<p>On this screen look at the top row of sizes and in the “Custom Size” option type 1440 for the width, 3000 for the height, and then hit enter.</p>

<p>Once you see the artboard you just created you can doubl click on the text at the top left of the artboard that says “custom-1” and change the name of the artbaord. Not entirely necessary but a good habit to get in as you build more complex sites in Xd.</p>

<p>One more thing you might want to change is the “Viewport Height” option in the right sidebar under “Scrolling”. This is probably set to 3000 as the default and I would suggest moving it to 900. What this does is adjust the height that Xd prievews when you hit the play icon in the top right. Not so useful for Exercise 2 but very useful for designing actual sites.</p>

<p>Finally, save the document before you move on to the next step. Adobe wants you to use the cloud to save your documents so if you want to use that you can go to <em>File &gt; Save…</em> or use <em>cmd+s</em>. If you do not want to use the cloud to save your documents you can go to <em>File &gt; Save as Local Document…</em> or use <em>opt+shift+cmd+s</em>. Save this as some version of<br />
<strong>e1</strong> or <strong>exercise1</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-create-a-grid"><span id="step2">Step 3: Create a Grid</span></h3>
<p>Now before you start adding anything to your artboard you want to set up a grid. This is accomplished by finding the grid section of the right sidebar and checking the box next to the layout dropdown. When you check that box it will bring up options for you to create your grid.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1p3/step3.png" alt="image of Xd grid options" title="Step 3" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Columns – How many columns are on the artboard. Also if you click the color to the left of the word “Columns” you can change the column color and opacity.</li>
  <li>Gutter Width – The width between the columns in pixels</li>
  <li>Column Width – The width of each column</li>
  <li>Two Icons – The first sets the margins for the left and right equally. The second allows you to set the margins independently. Generally leave it on the first option.</li>
</ul>

<p>Play around with these options and see what happens. There is no particular number for columns, widths, or gutters so it is up to you. In Exercise 2 you will be making 5 different artboards with 5 different grids so you can see what works well for you.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-add-content"><span id="step3">Step 4: Add Content</span></h3>
<p>This tutorial is primarily a set up for Exercise 2 so the content you will be adding are shapes. In the left toolbar there are a few different shape tools you can use — rectangle (<em>r</em>), ellipse (<em>e</em>), and polygon (<em>y</em>). The rectangle and ellipse tool draw what they say and if you hold <em>shift</em> while drawing the shape you will get a square or a circle. The polygon tool is a little different so choose that one or press <em>y</em> to see the additional options.</p>

<p>By default the polygon tool draws a triangle and if you hold shift it will draw and equilateral triangle. Draw a triangle on your artboard and make sure it aligns to the grid you made. The mouse should snap to the edges of the columns.</p>

<p>The default drawing of the triangle for me is a white fill with a grey border. The options here are generally the same for the rectangle and ellipse tools but the polygon tool has a few added options to control what the polygon looks like.</p>
