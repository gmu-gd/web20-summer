<p>Read through each discussion post from your classmates and create a web page that answers each question asked. That means you will answer 20 questions total ‚Äî 19 of your classmates questions plus one of your own. The page will be simple and use default styles but should display the question and your answer in a clear way. If you need a little help starting, check out the <a href="/tutorials/1-point-2">1.2 tutorial</a>.</p>

<h4 id="exercise-2-make-the-grid"><span id="e2">Exercise 2: Make the Grid</span></h4>
<p>Using XD or other approved design software make 5 artboards that are 1440 pixels wide by 3000 pixels tall. On each artboard create a grid that could be used to layout a website. The grid does not need rows, only columns. Once you have 5 different grids start adding some ‚Äúcontent‚Äù to your pages. The content should be shapes (squares, rectangles, circles) that could represent images, icons, text, etc. Some shapes should be tall, some shapes should be short, some should be wide, and some should be narrow. Use your grid to determine what makes sense where. The grid should be your guide for how your shapes line up and fit on the page. Do not ignore the grid. Check out the <a href="/tutorials/1-point-3">1.3 tutorial</a> for some help with XD if you need it.</p>
