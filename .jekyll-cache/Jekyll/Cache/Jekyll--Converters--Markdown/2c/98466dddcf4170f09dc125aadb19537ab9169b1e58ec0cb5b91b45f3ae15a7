<h3 id="step-1-make-a-github-account"><span id="step1">Step 1: Make a Github account</span></h3>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and set up an account if you do not have one yet. You should be able to sign up from that page. Make sure you use an email address you use and a password you will remember. You will have verify your email so make sure you do that too.</p>

<h4 id="step-2a-new-repository">Step 2A: New Repository</h4>
<p>Once you have made and verified your account, sign in to Github. On the main page you should see an option to create a repository. Wherever that might be, click it to start the process of creating a new repository. On the screenshot below it is the green button that says “new” over in the left sidebar.</p>

<h4 id="step-2b-create-repository">Step 2B: Create Repository</h4>
<p>On the next screen you need to fill in a few pieces of information. You need to fill in the repository name. This can be anything but I would recommend something like “avt217” or “introtoweb” or something similar. I would keep it all lowercase and don’t use any spaces. You do not need a description and keep the repository public. The final step here is to check the box that says “Initialize this repository with a README.” Not checking this box will force you to delete the repository and start over so make sure you check it.</p>

<p>Once you have a repository name and have checked the box, click create repository.</p>
